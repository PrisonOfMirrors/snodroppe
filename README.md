## Story Brief

Far in the future humans have turned into something vile. Are they robots? Cyborgs? Is sapience and a sense of self still existent? A group of young boys find themselves trapped and began to ponder what life used to be like. Where are they? Will they escape? Is there still even a world beyond the walls?

Find out, if you so dare...

I will eventually make a Swedish translation once I become more fluent, for all you vikings out there :)
