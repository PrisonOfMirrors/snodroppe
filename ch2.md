After playtime it was time to wind down. "Head to the west exit. You will now use the bathroom." screeched a static voice over the intercom. The intercom repeated again while the exit door raised open. The boys and the other kids formed a line and began to leave the room. "Two at a time" said the intercom. "Psst". "Psst" Markus felt someone poking his back. "Did you finally win?" said Neil. Markus turned around and gasped with a short "No!". "Ah that stinks. You'll get him next time." Neil replied. Jake was standing in front of the two and had chuckled with a contempt smile on his face.

Two by two the children took turns using the bathroom. Billy was holding his legs tightly "Come on I can't hold it much longer". Jake laughed for a moment then replied "You are like a lemon ready to be squeezed". A moment later the intercom shouted "Next!" as Jake and Billy went into the bathroom. This was no ordinary bathroom: it was huge yet largely empty--with only two stalls sitting in the back corner. Markus was looking up at the ceiling corner focusing hard. "What is it?" said Neil. Markus looked back down "Oh nothing..." he sighed.

Jake and Billy exited the bathroom and waited in the other line for bed. "Our turn" said Neil. The two entered and Neil went into one of the stalls. Meanwhile Markus stood by the sink and puzzled. Neil finished and headed towards him "You didn't have to go?" he said. "Not really" replied Markus. "There's something on my mind". "I think something is off here. Like, why is this bathroom so big?" he gasped and turned towards Neil. "Maybe the architect just overestimated the size of things" he responded. "That shiny eye... I feel like it's watching me. Like it knows me" Markus said quietly. The two finished up and headed out.

"Ah whatever try not to think to much" said Neil. A man with a gray uniform stood in front of the line. There was a smudged badge on the shirt which read "Linn". "I'll talk later Markus" Neil said as he followed the man. Markus stood for a moment until the man returned. "Come" said the man in a mechanical tone. Markus began to follow him down the hall. "Left foot right foot left foot" Markus was saying to himself. They passed many doors until finally stopping. The man faced the door and pressed his hand against the black pad next to it.

The door opened up and the man walked away. Markus went into the room as the door closed behind him. The room was small, cold, and all gray. It felt so bland, but he made the best of it. There was a small bed with a book next to it and in the corner a stuffed Tyrannosaurus Rex. He went over to the corner and set down his cards next to the stuffed animal. "Maybe next time buddy" he said while tearing up and hugging it. He then lied down in bed and closed his eyes for a moment. It began to smell a little sweet.

Markus was drifting off until the air hastily grew bitter. He quickly got out of bed and lifted up the mattress. He dug his fingers into a small tear and pulled out a piece of paper. "Oh where is it, where is it" he said panting. He finally found it and pulled out a small pencil. He quickly made a marking on the paper then put it back into the mattress. In a flash of a moment he lied down and had fallen asleep.
