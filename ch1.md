Buzz buzz... it was that time again: playtime. What adventures await today? Are they the same as yesterday? When even was yesterday? Time is something we've long forgotten in here. Markus was thinking hard about today's game. He wouldn't dare lose his chocolate chip cookies to Jake yet again. "Two left, then one right, and attack from the rear" he said to himself. It has to work, why wouldn't it?

"Are you ready for another butt whooping?" chanted Jake. "Eat my dirty socks!" replied Markus. The two finished lunch and handed their cookies to Billy. This was going to be intense. "You first" said Jake. Markus drew his cards then carefully placed them down. Jake took a moment to think then placed down his. "Call it" he said. Markus flipped over a card on the left. "Stegosaurus" he said. Jake followed by flipping over a card of Markus'. It was a Triceratops, oh no. "He takes you on like a mighty steer and crushes you". "Ugh" sighed Jake as he removed his card from the field.

The battle continued for a bit until Markus was down to his last card. It was time to pull the final move and attack from behind. "Say hello to my Tyrannosaurus Rex" he barked. "Not so fast"... Jake flipped over a surprise card. "Pterodactyl swarm comes in from the sky, your puny arms can't touch me". "No no not again!" gasped Markus. Billy called the game and started to hand the cookies to Jake when he was interrupted by a loud beep. "What was that?" said Billy.

The three ran over to the glass wall at the end of the room to watch. There were lights flashing on the other side and the sound of footsteps. "Oh no, oh no no no" Markus gasped very quietly. Left foot right foot left foot. The steps grew louder until out came a gray figure from around the corner. It was tall, bright, and was holding a large object--it was Frank. He continued walking: left foot right foot left foot--and stopped in front of the boys. He paused at a moments brief and then his neck twisted slowly in a grueling manner so the head faced them. "Huh" gasped Billy. "Stay calm" Markus grabbed Billy's arm firmly.

A moment later the head twisted back and he continued walking. They could hear a young girl speaking faintly on the other side: "I'm so happy, so very happy", "There will be no more rainy days, there will be no more skies of gray". A metal wall began closing down and covered the window. "Wait wait why can't we see her" said Billy. "She was chosen to move to the big kid's playroom" whispered Jake. "Only they are honored to see it". There was a moment of silence... then click, tick... BANG. A loud thud came from the floor. The metal wall reeled back up and Frank was gone along with the girl.

"Alright the action is over, I'd like to eat those cookies now" Jake said as he tapped Markus on the back. Billy and Jake began to walk back. Markus new what had really happened. He knew very well, and he knew he couldn't tell anyone. "They all walk the same" he said. "They always walk the same"...
