\chapter{They Walk the Same}

Buzz buzz... it was that time again: playtime. What adventures await today? Are they the same as yesterday? When even was yesterday? Time is something we've long forgotten in here. Markus was thinking hard about today's game. He wouldn't dare lose his chocolate chip cookies to Jake yet again. "Two left, then one right, and attack from the rear" he said to himself. It has to work, why wouldn't it?

"Are you ready for another butt whooping?" chanted Jake. "Eat my dirty socks!" replied Markus. The two finished lunch and handed their cookies to Billy. This was going to be intense. "You first" said Jake. Markus drew his cards then carefully placed them down. Jake took a moment to think then placed down his. "Call it" he said. Markus flipped over a card on the left. "Stegosaurus" he said. Jake followed by flipping over a card of Markus'. It was a Triceratops, oh no. "He takes you on like a mighty steer and crushes you". "Ugh" sighed Jake as he removed his card from the field.

The battle continued for a bit until Markus was down to his last card. It was time to pull the final move and attack from behind. "Say hello to my Tyrannosaurus Rex" he barked. "Not so fast"... Jake flipped over a surprise card. "Pterodactyl swarm comes in from the sky, your puny arms can't touch me". "No no not again!" gasped Markus. Billy called the game and started to hand the cookies to Jake when he was interrupted by a loud beep. "What was that?" said Billy.

The three ran over to the glass wall at the end of the room to watch. There were lights flashing on the other side and the sound of footsteps. "Oh no, oh no no no" Markus gasped very quietly. Left foot right foot left foot. The steps grew louder until out came a gray figure from around the corner. It was tall, bright, and was holding a large object--it was Frank. He continued walking: left foot right foot left foot--and stopped in front of the boys. He paused at a moments brief and then his neck twisted slowly in a grueling manner so the head faced them. "Huh" gasped Billy. "Stay calm" Markus grabbed Billy's arm firmly.

A moment later the head twisted back and he continued walking. They could hear a young girl speaking faintly on the other side: "I'm so happy, so very happy", "There will be no more rainy days, there will be no more skies of gray". A metal wall began closing down and covered the window. "Wait wait why can't we see her" said Billy. "She was chosen to move to the big kid's playroom" whispered Jake. "Only they are honored to see it". There was a moment of silence... then click, tick... BANG. A loud thud came from the floor. The metal wall reeled back up and Frank was gone along with the girl.

"Alright the action is over, I'd like to eat those cookies now" Jake said as he tapped Markus on the back. Billy and Jake began to walk back. Markus new what had really happened. He knew very well, and he knew he couldn't tell anyone. "They all walk the same" he said. "They always walk the same"...

\chapter{Doubts}

After playtime it was time to wind down. "Head to the west exit. You will now use the bathroom." screeched a static voice over the intercom. The intercom repeated again while the exit door raised open. The boys and the other kids formed a line and began to leave the room. "Two at a time" said the intercom. "Psst". "Psst" Markus felt someone poking his back. "Did you finally win?" said Neil. Markus turned around and gasped with a short "No!". "Ah that stinks. You'll get him next time." Neil replied. Jake was standing in front of the two and had chuckled with a contempt smile on his face.

Two by two the children took turns using the bathroom. Billy was holding his legs tightly "Come on I can't hold it much longer". Jake laughed for a moment then replied "You are like a lemon ready to be squeezed". A moment later the intercom shouted "Next!" as Jake and Billy went into the bathroom. This was no ordinary bathroom: it was huge yet largely empty--with only two stalls sitting in the back corner. Markus was looking up at the ceiling corner focusing hard. "What is it?" said Neil. Markus looked back down "Oh nothing..." he sighed.

Jake and Billy exited the bathroom and waited in the other line for bed. "Our turn" said Neil. The two entered and Neil went into one of the stalls. Meanwhile Markus stood by the sink and puzzled. Neil finished and headed towards him "You didn't have to go?" he said. "Not really" replied Markus. "There's something on my mind". "I think something is off here. Like, why is this bathroom so big?" he gasped and turned towards Neil. "Maybe the architect just overestimated the size of things" he responded. "That shiny eye... I feel like it's watching me. Like it knows me" Markus said quietly. The two finished up and headed out.

"Ah whatever try not to think to much" said Neil. A man with a gray uniform stood in front of the line. There was a smudged badge on the shirt which read "Lynn". "I'll talk later Markus" Neil said as he followed the man. Markus stood for a moment until the man returned. "Come" said the man in a mechanical tone. Markus began to follow him down the hall. "Left foot right foot left foot" Markus was saying to himself. They passed many doors until finally stopping. The man faced the door and pressed his hand against the black pad next to it.

The door opened up and the man walked away. Markus went into the room as the door closed behind him. The room was small, cold, and all gray. It felt so bland, but he made the best of it. There was a small bed with a book next to it and in the corner a stuffed Tyrannosaurus Rex. He went over to the corner and set down his cards next to the stuffed animal. "Maybe next time buddy" he said while tearing up and hugging it. He then lied down in bed and closed his eyes for a moment. It began to smell a little sweet.

Markus was drifting off until the air hastily grew bitter. He quickly got out of bed and lifted up the mattress. He dug his fingers into a small tear and pulled out a piece of paper. "Oh where is it, where is it" he said panting. He finally found it and pulled out a small pencil. He quickly made a marking on the paper then put it back into the mattress. In a flash of a moment he lied down and had fallen asleep.
